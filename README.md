# System Processes Parser

This Python script parses the output of the `ps aux` command to generate a system report with information about running processes. The script uses the `subprocess` module from the Python standard library to execute the `ps aux` command and parse its output.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in a terminal:

```bash
python system_processes_parser.py
```

The script will output a report to the standard output and save it to a file with the current date and time in the format `DD-MM-YYYY-HH:MM-scan.txt`.

## Report

The system report generated by the script contains the following information:

- System users: a list of all system users found in the output of the `ps aux` command.
- Total number of processes: the total number of processes running on the system.
- User processes: the number of processes for each user found in the output of the `ps aux` command.
- Memory usage: the percentage of total system memory used by all processes.
- CPU usage: the percentage of total CPU usage used by all processes.
- Process with highest memory usage: the name (or first 20 characters) of the process with the highest memory usage.
- Process with highest CPU usage: the name (or first 20 characters) of the process with the highest CPU usage.

## Example Output

```
System status report: 2023-05-01 14:37:55

Users: 'root', 'user1', 'user2', ...

Total number of processes: 833

User processes:
root: 533
user1: 231
user2: 69
...

Memory usage: 45.7%
CPU usage: 33.2%

Process with highest memory usage: /usr/bin/dockerd
Process with highest CPU usage: /usr/bin/python3
```

## Dependencies

This script uses only the Python standard library, specifically the `subprocess` module. No additional dependencies are required.
